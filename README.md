🦆 Goose Hunt (using phaser 3)

This repository contains a simple, arcade-style target practice game, inspired by classic "Duck Hunt" mechanics. It serves as a single-file, zero-dependency (other than external CDNs) demonstration of modern HTML5 game development, physics simulation, and reliable web audio integration.

🎯 Features

Arcade Gameplay: Time-based scoring system (30 seconds to catch as many geese as possible).

Responsive Physics: Uses the Phaser 3 Arcade Physics engine to control the velocity, movement, and boundaries of the targets.

Modern Web Audio: Implements the Tone.js library to reliably generate sound effects (gunshot) upon user interaction, bypassing common browser autoplay policies and demonstrating proficiency with the Web Audio API.

Single-File Deployment: All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and game logic are contained within one index.html file, making deployment instantaneous via services like GitHub Pages.

Interactive Cursor: Custom cursor implemented via SVG data URI for an immersive crosshair experience.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Frontend Language: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

Game Framework: Phaser 3
